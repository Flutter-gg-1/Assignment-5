        I don't have much hobbies, like any other guy in my age group I enjoy playing ${hobbies[0]} 🎮
        with my siblings, sometimes when I feel bored I enjoy ${hobbies[1]} 🎥 🍿 specially the
        sci-fi ones, they really are my favorite type of movies. Those are my hobbies !
        wait what ? you mean ${hobbies[2]} 🤨 ? ${hobbies[2]} isn't a hobby. ${hobbies[2]} is a life style 😉
